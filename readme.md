This repository provides examples as jupyter notebooks on how to use Azure Machine learning service python SDK.
In order to get started with Azure Machine learning SDK, We highly recommend to go through the tutorials and samples in [Azure ML official repo](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks) first.

## Table of Samples

* **[Face recognition through time](https://github.com/Azure/AMLSamples/tree/master/facereco)** sample demonstrates how to train an [Azure Machine learning pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-ml-pipelines).
* **[Predictive maintenance](https://github.com/Azure/AMLSamples/tree/master/predictive_maintenance)** scenario previously available under AML Workbench trained on Azure Databricks.
* **[Deep Predictive maintenance](https://github.com/Azure/AMLSamples/tree/master/deep_predictive_maintenance)** scenario previously available under AML Workbench trained using Pytorch.
* **[Customer churn](https://github.com/Azure/AMLSamples/tree/master/customer_churn)** scenario previously available under AML Workbench trained using deep kernel learning.
* **[Distributed training using TF high level API](https://github.com/Azure/AMLSamples/tree/master/tf_estimator_horovod)** sample demonstrates how to perform distributed training using horovod and tf.estimator with tf.data dataset on Azure ML service.
* **[Distributed training using tf.keras](https://github.com/Azure/AMLSamples/tree/master/keras_horovod)** sample demonstrates how to perform distributed training using horovod with Tensorflow Keras and tf.data dataset on Azure ML service.
* **[Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Azure/AMLSamples/tree/master/sentiment_analysis)** sample previously available under AML Workbench now trained on Azure Machine learning service using Fast AI NLP pipepline.
